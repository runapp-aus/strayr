The `strayr` package provides tools to make working with Australian
data easier. This includes:

-   tidy versions of common structures used by the Australian Bureau of
    Statistics (ABS), like ANZSIC and ANZSCO:

-   a function to tidy up state names (`clean_states()`); and

-   a function that knows whether particular dates are public holidays
    (`is_holiday()`).

This package is currently **in development** and subject to change. The
lifecycle badge will be changed to `stable` when it is stable (should be
relatively soon).

**Contribute to this package**: people are actively encouraged to
contribute to this package.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `strayr` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("runapp-aus/strayr")
```

## Structures

Current structures stored in `strayr` are:

-   `anzsco2009`: occupation levels of the [Australian and New Zealand
    Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO), First Edition,
    Revision 1, 2009. Cat.
    1220.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1220.0First%20Edition,%20Revision%201?OpenDocument).
-   `anzsic2006`: industry levels of the [Australian and New Zealand
    Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), 2006 (Revision 1.0).
    Cat.

-   `asced_foe2001`: field of education levels of the [Australian Standard
    Classification of Education (ASCED), 2001. Cat.
    1272.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1272.0).
-   `asced_qual2001`: qualification levels of the [Australian Standard
    Classification of Education (ASCED), 2001. Cat.
    1272.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1272.0).

The `strayr` package also loads

the following structures *and their geometry* as `sf` objects:

## Converting state names and abbreviations

The `clean_state()` function makes it easy to wrangle vectors of State names and abbreviations - which might be in different forms and possibly
misspelled.

## Australian public holidays
This package includes the `auholidays` dataset from the [Australian Public Holidays Dates Machine Readable Dataset](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/australian-holidays-machine-readable-dataset) as well as a helper function `is_holiday`:



## Parsing income ranges

The `parse_income_range` function provides some tools for extracting numbers from income ranges commonly used in Australian data. For example:

```{r}

parse_income_range("$1-$199 ($1-$10,399)", limit = "lower")

  
```
